title: "TTRPG Safety Tools"
---

When doing any sort of role-playing game, it is important to have some safety tools. This can be as simple as a conversation during "session zero" where you discuss the likely themes of the campaign or something more formal and systematized. I think these tools are under-discussed, especially relative to how beneficial they can be for maximizing the enjoyment of everyone at the table. Hopefully this document helps formalize things you've already known about and--maybe--introduces you to new tools!
