_Featherlight_ is a rules-light, setting-neutral tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG). _Featherlight_ is built to be as welcoming as possible for novice TTRPG players while still providing an enjoyable experience for more experienced players. This purpose also helps it be a great starting point for players interested in being the game master but intimidated by "crunchier" systems where it can feel impossible to know the rules well enough to be the arbiter of them in a game. Additionally, because the mechanics are so flexible, they can be easily applied to any world where you want to spend some more time (e.g., beloved book series, popular anime, personal OC/homebrew, etc.)!

In short, **_Featherlight_ is built to be the backdrop for you to take big narrative swings in whatever setting sparks the most joy for your table**. Have fun and good luck!

AI was not used in _any_ facet of this work. Please respect this by not feeding any _Featherlight_ content (from this website or elsewhere) into those systems. Thanks!

## Following _Featherlight_

This website is probably the best source of information about _Featherlight_ but you can also check out _Featherlight's_ {{< fa brands tumblr >}} Tumblr ([tumblr.com/featherlight-ttrpg](https://www.tumblr.com/featherlight-ttrpg)) for more updates. **I'll also be starting a Kickstarter soon** to gather funds for commissioning an artist to illustrate [the homebrew settings](https://njlyon0.github.io/featherlight-ttrpg/settings.html) that I'm working on so stay tuned for that!

## Rulebook

While _Featherlight_ certainly tries to be rules-light, it wouldn't be much of a TTRPG system if it had no rules at all. **I'm _so close_ to being ready to release a rulebook PDF (for free!/[PWYW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want)) so just hang in there as I iron out the last few kinks in version 1.0!**

### Playtest Packet

In the meantime, I've put together a playtest packet (one-page PDF) outlining the core structure of _Featherlight's_ mechanics. Please feel free to download it from [this {{< fa brands google-drive >}} Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sO61MZ8tYG-WcLlM7gu54VIYxzgjz9Gp) and use it to test out _Featherlight_ before the more formal rulebook is released.

## Feedback

If you've played a _Featherlight_ session, served as the game master, or even just read the playtest packet and want to share feedback: thank you! **_Featherlight_ is a labor of love and it can only be improved by hearing what worked (or didn't) in your experiences at home with the game.**

For now, I'm collecting feedback using [an anonymous {{< fa brands google >}} Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoJj94axFaDMChWS0IYLwef9Xh8JD1o3oavskA9cIXVddlyA/viewform?usp=dialog) so please feel free to share any positive or constructively critical feedback there. You can also message me on {{< fa brands tumblr >}} Tumblr ([\@featherlight-ttrpg](https://www.tumblr.com/featherlight-ttrpg)) if you'd rather have the chance for a back-and-forth conversation.
