    "text": "Featherlight is a rules-light, setting-neutral tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG). Featherlight is built to be as welcoming as possible for novice TTRPG players while still providing an enjoyable experience for more experienced players. This purpose also helps it be a great starting point for players interested in being the game master but intimidated by “crunchier” systems where it can feel impossible to know the rules well enough to be the arbiter of them in a game.\nIn short, Featherlight is built for you to take big narrative swings in whatever setting sparks the most joy for your table. Have fun and good luck!"
